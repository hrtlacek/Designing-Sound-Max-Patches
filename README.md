# Designing-Sound-Max-Patches

This repository forked from [this Repo](https://github.com/unriginal/Designing-Sound-Max-Patches), merged it with [Holland Hopsons's Work](http://fieldguide.hollandhopson.com/tag/andy-farnell/), taking examples by taste and how well they work.

All of the practical examples from the book [Designing Sound by Andy Farnell](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/designing-sound), ported to Max 7.

Some examples may have bugs, and many examples look very ugly. Feel free to report any issues or requests to the bug tracker, for a quicker response 
time than whenever I feel like rexamining the patches.
